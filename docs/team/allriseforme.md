PROJECT: Nuke
==============================

---

Overview
========

This Nuke application is a simple yet powerful task management system that is dedicated to providing NUS students efficient organisation of *modules* and *tasks*. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC.

Summary of contributions
========================
**Code contributed**: \[[Functional code](https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=a11riseforme)\]

**Major enhancement**: 

1. added **the ability to undo/redo previous commands**

- What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
- Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
- Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

2. added the **ability to preload the information of all modules provided by NUS**

**Minor enhancement**: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
