In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel power play, market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand what channels are for. Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run."},{"moduleCode":"BMA5530","title":"Design Thinking & Product Innovations","description":"This module focuses on integrating Design Thinking into the creative development of innovative products and services.

Some of the topics covered include the following:\n\n1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students\nare asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses\nand are asked to develop tests to detect the difference.\n\n2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments\n(for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a\nmedical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time\nconversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test\nwhether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first\nor last to a cup of tea.\n\n3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ\ntesting?\n\n4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific\nmodels are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such\nmodels predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on\nthe other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different\npossible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding\nembedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical\napproaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying\nuncertainty important?\n\n5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random\nrules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by\nother means?\n\n6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in\nwhich massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being\nsearched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market\nresearch for example)?"},{"moduleCode":"FMS1204S","title":"FS: Fraud, Deception and Data","description":"The purpose of this seminar is to explore the relationship between fraud and\ndeception and statistics.

Structures and electronic\nand magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced\nto the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre =\n10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical,\noptical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size.\nThe nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the\ntraditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and\nengineering.\n\nTo understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance\nspectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray\nabsorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray\nphotoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy,\nangular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction.

Since ancient times, philosophers and mathematicians have been debating questions about the nature of mathematics. In this seminar, we join their debate and look at questions about the nature of mathematics related to both ontology and epistemology. For example, What is the nature of mathematical truth? Do mathematical objects and facts exist independently of human consciousness? Are theorems invented or discovered? How does one explain the unreasonable usefulness of mathematics? Do we really need more and more abstract mathematical concepts?"},{"moduleCode":"FMS1214B","title":"Mysteries of Water, Protein Aggregation and Diseases","description":"Despite the apparent simplicity of the water molecule, water is probably the most mysterious substance to both science and religions. Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. To our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the “matrix of life”. Nevertheless, various scientific debates are associated with water. For example, unbelievably, in the 1980s French scientist Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the “memory of water”.\n\nOn the other hand, proteins are the most important functional players for all forms of life.  An increasing spectrum of human diseases more than neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by aggregation of specific proteins, while aggregation of non-specific proteins are associated with aging even down to Escherichia coli. In 2005, we discovered that these “aggregated/insoluble” proteins could marvellously be solubilized in pure water, which thus offers my group to tackle an emerging but challenging problem in biology: molecular mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases and aging.\n\nIn this module, we will explore how water shaped the emergence and evolution of life and how proteins get aggregated and subsequently gain toxicity to trigger diseases and aging. Most importantly, the students will have a full freedom to give their own opinions on these topics/debates."},{"moduleCode":"FMS1214P","title":"Silk: Fibers that make a difference in our world","description":"After long evolution, many biomaterials are of ultra-performance than the artificial ones.

It includes branches such as biology, medicine, anthropology and ecology. Physics on the other hand, studies the fundamental relationship between matter, energy, space, and time. Many people may consider them to be in different regimes and require different mindsets to work on. But as both disciplines advanced, it became increasingly clear that the interactions between them are far more pervasive and fundamental than one might expect. For example, the field of biophysics has risen since the 1950s, and it has vastly changed how biologists look at living systems or study biology. It proved that the mindsets of biology and physics can join together to provide deeper insight into the phenomenon we call life. We will base the material on the basic laws of physics, and discuss how they are interwined with all kinds of life science and daily life phenomena, from cells to ecosystems and from Earth to outer space. Through reading this module, the students would be able to think deeper about the daily phenomena around them, and understand better the foundation of life on Earth."},{"moduleCode":"GET1014","title":"The Art of Science, the Science of Art","description":"It often seems the worlds of science and art are unrelated: Logical truth versus emotional imagination.

In particular, we give an introduction of elementary non-zero sum and non-cooperative game as developed by von Neumann and Nash."},{"moduleCode":"GET1020","title":"Darwin and Evolution","description":"Charles Darwin is remembered like no other figure in the history of science. However, public understanding of Darwin and evolution remains a serious problem. What most people think they know about Darwin, his life and his famous book ‘On the origin of species’ is wrong. This module provides a solid background for understanding how the theory of evolution actually unfolded. It covers the history of geology, palaeontology and biology from the 1700s to the 20th century. The central focus is on the life and work of Charles Darwin and how biological evolution was uncovered, debated and accepted by the international scientific community in the 19th century, and beyond. There will be a lot of myth busting and this provides case studies on how to assess historical claims and evidence, and discussions on recent developments in evolutionary biology, human evolution and anthropology are included."},{"moduleCode":"GET1021","title":"Critical Thinking And Writing","description":"The challenges of a global engineer increasingly call upon engineers to think critically and communicate effectively to undertake developmental leadership.

These include Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Moore, Austin and Quine.  The fundamental assumption in analytic philosophy is the idea that all philosophical problems are really problems of language and may be solved either by reformulating them in a perfect language or by a better understanding of the language that we actually speak.  One of the aims of this course is to show how certain problems in ethics, metaphysics and epistemology may be solved (or dissolved) through the careful analysis of language and meaning."},{"moduleCode":"PH3207","title":"Continental European Philosophy","description":"CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHY"},{"moduleCode":"PH3213","title":"Knowledge, Modernity and Global Change","description":"This module focuses on the ways in which modern science and technology impact on the forms-of-life which cultures and societies have built up for their collective self-understanding and biological survival.

We say things such as ‘It’ll probably rain later’, ‘It’s unlikely that an asteroid will collide with Earth any time\nsoon’, and ‘There’s a chance that the restaurant will be open’. But what exactly is probability? We shall investigate various answers to this question by looking\nat various theories of probability, including the subjective theory, the epistemic theory, the frequency theory, and the propensity theory. Along the way, we’ll\nsee how issues in the philosophy of probability bear on issues in the philosophy of science, metaphysics, and epistemology."},{"moduleCode":"PH3245","title":"Language and Thought","description":"Topics at the intersection of philosophy of mind and language, such as whether thought depends on talk or vice versa, whether we think in words or images, whether those words are words of English or a sui generis mental language just for thinking, whether animals which can’t talk can think and whether the mind is like a computer. These questions are central to contemporary philosophy and language and are also an important case study in the relationship between\nthe methods of analysis, experiment and introspection in philosophical psychology."},{"moduleCode":"PH3261","title":"Kant's Critique of Pure Reason","description":"Kant is widely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers, if not the greatest, and his Critique of Pure Reason is widely considered his greatest work.

One of the most important aspects of social justice is the way in which societies deal with the collective provision of welfare for their members. Following a brief introduction to influential theories of justice, this course will look at the historical roots of the welfare state and at the central features of various presently existing welfare regimes. Cases will be drawn from Europe, the United States, and East Asia."},{"moduleCode":"SC4226","title":"Cultural Production: Power, Voice, Policies","description":"This module considers cultural production as an arena of contestation for voice and visibility. It explores how creative performances and productions have been\nused to express, subvert, or redefine social realities and values, constitute publics, and initiate change. A variety of forms, such as street theatres, music,\ncartoons, community and online media, will be explored through an anthropological engagement with the everyday politics of recognition, narration,\nbelonging, and indeed the valuation of one’s voice. Power, performance, agency, creativity, audiences, art worlds and aesthetics are among the key concepts explored."},{"moduleCode":"SC4227","title":"Gender, Sex and Power","description":"All societies are organized around gender and sexuality. Everywhere, the sex/gender system has implications for the relative power of men and women in society. Human societies have a tendency toward patriarchy. Some societies are relatively gender‐egalitarian. Others are strongly patriarchal. But none are strongly matriarchal. This module examines the social, cultural, psychological and biological arguments, including feminist and non‐feminist theories for how and why sex and gender relate to the distribution of power in society. It examines these questions in terms of broad comparison across cultures, in evolutionary history, in modern state societies and in today’s transnational, globalizing world."},{"moduleCode":"SC4228","title":"Making Sense of Violence","description":"What is violence? How is violence materialized, contested and reproduced? What can anthropology offer to understandings of violence? Exploring  phenomena ranging from war, genocide and terrorism to domestic abuse, poverty and crime, this course examines violence as a domain of cultural understanding and a mode of social action. Involving both overt and\nspectacular expressions and implicit and everyday forms, our understandings of violence will span the intimacy of the family, the nationalisms of states and the economics of global corporations. Through the comparison of cross-cultural ethnographies, we look critically at the theoretical, empirical, methodological and ethical implications of analysing violence."},{"moduleCode":"SC4401","title":"Honours Thesis","description":"This module requires students to conduct an independent research project on an approved topic under the supervision of an academic staff.

The critical role that transportation plays in structuring the city will also be examined. This course will be conducted intensively on a daily basis over a period of three weeks (usually beginning on the third week of Semester 1)."},{"moduleCode":"UD5628","title":"Sustainable Urban Design and Development","description":"The module engages the contemporary issues of urban ecology and its articulation to design and development in urban settings. The new commitment of the co-habitation of nature and built environment has drawn attentions of the architects, urban designers and environmental professionals. The discourses of urban sustainability have to move away from social sufficiency, ecological efficiency to ecosystem compatibility by linking the forms and flows of urban, industrial and natural systems. The new challenges of urban ecological issue require design and environmental professionals to deal with how urban and environment spaces could be analyzed, designed, managed, evaluated, represented and changed for responding to the cutting-edge sustainable issues. Divided by two main categories, Spatial Typologies and Ecological Flows, the series of lecture covers the trends and issues of sustainable urban design and development. Following the introductory lecture based on planning and design history, the Part One Spatial Typologies includes global ecological effects of mega urban form, suburbanization and propositions of sustainable city, downtown urban design, waterfront revitalization and brown field redevelopment. The Part Two Ecological Flows covers the ecological design issues of landscape ecological flow, material and energy flow, water flow and informational flow. The sessions conclude with the discussion of representational dimension of urban and environmental design that is essential to the professional practices of ecologically sound urban and environmental design. By selecting one of the specific sustainable urban issues, students are required to work on a research project, which is to be presented as a team work during the semester and further developed as an individual term paper at the end of semester."},{"moduleCode":"UHB2207","title":"Language, Cognition, and Culture","description":"This module explores the deep interconnections between language, cognition and culture. It begins with a consideration of the ‘discursive mind’ - that is, the particularly human way of knowing that uses language as its primary tool and medium. Realizing how much of human cognition is language-dependant,\nwe then explore the relations between language, cognition and culture by looking at such everyday linguistic phenomena as code-switching, metaphor and gesture. Augmenting the reading of sociolinguistic and cognitive science texts in this module, students will also learn how to collect and to analyze empirical\nevidence of language phenomena in order to more critically assess the claims of such texts."},{"moduleCode":"UHB2212","title":"Singaporean Nostalgia","description":"“Our generation,” Singaporean playwright Joel Tan remarks, “is sick with nostalgia.” From the popularity of retro and vintage styles to the proliferation of artwork\n(some state-sanctioned, some not) that lovingly look to and at our past, Singapore seems to be in the firm grip of nostalgia. Are these indeed manifestations of nostalgia? Is any interest in the past nostalgic, or does nostalgia consists of a style or a way of regarding the past? More importantly, how should we understand these nostalgic tendencies? In what senses is nostalgia a “sickness,” and can Singaporean practices of nostalgia help us rethink this characterization?

This module seeks to examine some of these biases and how they affect our decision making as we re-look at decision making theories. In this module, we seek answers to the question of, “What constitutes a good decision and what makes for a good decision maker?”\nWe will also discuss the implications of these biases from the social welfare perspective and explores how we can overcome these biases."},{"moduleCode":"UIS3901","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3901S","title":"Independent Study Module (ST)","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3902","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3902S","title":"Independent Study Module (ST)","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911EC","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911EL","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911EN","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911GE","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911HY","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911NM","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3911PS","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3931","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3932","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS3941","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS4911EL","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS4911EN","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS4911GL","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS4911PS","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIS4932","title":"Independent Study Module","description":""},{"moduleCode":"UIT2205","title":"Quantum computation","description":"One of the most recent advances in the area of computer science and information theory is the emergence of a new notion, the concept of quantum information. The module aims to provide an introduction to the field of quantum computing. While very much a technology of the future, the module will examine some of the possibilities that the quantum world offers in advancing the capabilities of computers and how our notion of information has evolved. Essentially the module showcases, two major paradigm shifts; one from classical physics to quantum physics and the other from the standard Turing principle in computer science to its modern quantum counterpart."},{"moduleCode":"UIT2208","title":"Thinking 4.0","description":"The 4th industrial revolution, combining notions from fields such as cybernetics, the maker world and artificial intelligence, is rapidly starting to take shape. The key\nunderlying human thought process is often represented by the term  ‘computational thinking’ but this thought process is much more than thinking like a programmer or computer-like. It is a broadly interdisciplinary process\nencompassing both the arts and the sciences, and essential for succeeding in an interconnected and data driven world. Indeed, thinking computationally is often\nmore like art than like math. This module, explores the thought processes behind computational thinking and considers applications in finance."},{"moduleCode":"ULS2201","title":"The Biomolecular Revolution","description":"This module aims to give an overview of a living cell, genetic basis of diseases, biological molecules and their applications in undertaking clinical challenges. In brief, the student will learn the basic concepts of molecular biology, genetics, genetic engineering and biotechnology relevant to the biomolecular revolution. New frontiers of the revolution will be discussed with the emphasis of their\nimpacts on the individual and society. Through contemporary readings, students will be provoked to think of issues arising from the biomolecular revolution."},{"moduleCode":"ULS2202","title":"Evolution","description":"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of Evolution This bold statement by the Russian population geneticist T. Dobzhansky emphasizes the importance of evolution as the only unifying concept in biology. Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\")."},{"moduleCode":"ULS2206","title":"The Doors of Perception: Biology, Technology & Culture","description":"When we open our eyes, we feel that we are seeing the world as it is in front of us. But scientific studies reveal that we are seeing only a tiny fraction of that world, and that what we do see (and hear, and smell, and touch) is not the world “as it is” – but as it is represented to us through the \nfilters of our biology, or technology, and our culture. This module will examine the ways in which these three important forces enable, limit and shape the ways that we perceive “the world in front of us”."},{"moduleCode":"ULS2208","title":"Biodiversity and Natural History in Singapore","description":"Situated within a megadiverse biodiversity-hotspot, Singapore has drastically-reduced natural areas yet remains surprisingly species-rich. Combined with her colonial legacy, infrastructural capabilities and cultural biases, Singapore offers a unique situation for studying biodiversity. In this module, we study how Singapore’s biodiversity landscape as well as the motivations and methods for studying biodiversity have evolved across Singapore’s history. Retracing how prominent naturalists explored Singapore’s biodiversity in the past, we imagine how they would do it today using current techniques. This module has a strong fieldwork component, imbuing students with naturalist sensibilities which heightens their awareness of Singapore’s diverse but oft-neglected natural heritage."},{"moduleCode":"UNL2201","title":"Space, Time & Matter: The Shape and Size of the Cosmos","description":"As an inquiry-tier module, students will be brought through a general framework for thinking about these issues lensed from philosophy mathematics and physics. Specifically,\n- The philosophical strand will expose students to some of the early conceptions of space, time and matter. Principally ideas of Descartes and Leibniz with emphasis on Kant’s concept of space and time. The mathematization of science in the 17th Century - from Descartes use of coordinate geometry to Galileo’s Principle of Inertia and the mathematics of motion will serve to showcase how the early concepts took shape.\n- The mathematical strand will serve to showcase how Euclid’s axiomatic approach to geometry formed the basis of subsequent generalizations that led to the characterization of space and time. Here students will be introduced to structures such as topological spaces, manifolds and Riemannian spaces that form the basis of the space-time fabric.\n- The physical strand will touch on the notion of physical symmetries and its relation to geometry. In particular, Galilean and Special relativity will serve to elucidate how the motion of particles in the space-time fabric reveals its geometrical structure. This will culminate in Einstein’s Equivalence Principle and its implications leading up to the General theory of Relativity.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a coherent exposition of how the three disciplines come together in providing insights into the nature of space, time and matter. The questions raised will force students to examine and reflect on the extent to which our commonsensical views of the physical space accurately describes the way nature really is; and to what degree this view is tenable on the basis of detailed quantitative reasons and empirical evidence. Hopefully, through this analysis, students will appreciate the subtle interplay between the realm of ideas and mental constructs and that of experiments and scientific facts."},{"moduleCode":"UNL2206","title":"Nature's Threads","description":"This module seeks to explore the importance of various key ideas in the history of physics by considering a selection of examples each semester as a means of examining the whys and hows of certain scientific revolutions. The theme underlying the choice of topics to be covered will be to explore the evolutionary aspect of scientific understanding which finds inter-connections (often, only much later, sometimes even centuries later) between seemingly unrelated ideas. The student should take away from this module a sense of the revolutionary nature and scientific importance of the ideas explored that semester, as well as the deep inter-connections which science establishes - 'Nature's Threads' as it were."},{"moduleCode":"UNL2210","title":"Mathematics and Reality","description":"What is the nature of Reality and how can we be sure about what we know? Do mathematical constructs such as symmetry groups and infinity point beyond themselves to a higher reality? How do we account for the fact that mathematics is so effective in describing nature? Is it mere language or is it the reality itself? This module explores the intimate link between reality and mathematics and how the latter has been unreasonably effective in providing a description of nature. Students will be taken through a journey that showcases the developments that have shaped our current views on the topic."},{"moduleCode":"UPC2206","title":"Nanoscale Science And Technology","description":"Nanotechnology is a relatively new field, and there is still controversy over its future potential. This module aims to acquaint students with the current topics in nanoscience, while engaging them in a dialogue on future possibilities, as well as the social and environmental implications of nanotechnology.

For example why are plastics non-biodegradable? Why and how an LED lights up or gets quenched, or one drug molecule works while another results in side effects? These are important outcomes resulting directly or indirectly from initial  intermolecular forces. Environmental issues such as differentiation between\nbiodegradable and “unfriendly” materials can also be discussed. Stereochemical or 3D-controlled intermolecular forces allow an understanding of many chemical processes in biological systems."},{"moduleCode":"UPC2209","title":"Pollution Control Engineering in Singapore","description":"Clean air and water are crucial for public health and to ensure a safe supply of drinking water. Pollution to our air and water can pose health risks and increase treatment costs. This module explores topics related to environmental pollution that threatens clean air and water.

However, it is still debatable whether or not science and determinism were sufficient to understand the whole material world. Through reviewing our understanding of the origins of the Universe, Earth, Life, Mankind and Civilisation, the module helps us to reflect our understanding of the material world along the historical timeline and we would analyse the role of determinism in our perception of the material world."},{"moduleCode":"UPI2211","title":"Utopia: Ideal Places from Plato to the Smart City","description":"From the ancient world to the present day, philosophers, novelists, and social thinkers have attempted to envision ideal states. Utopian texts often present us with provocative thought experiments, addressing fundamental questions about justice, leadership, and human flourishing. In this module, we will critically examine representations of ideal states ranging from Plato's Republic to contemporary visions about smart cities. We will focus in particular on the roles of governance, labor, and technology in the construction of utopian projects and discuss whether the utopian imagination is still relevant in the present day."},{"moduleCode":"UPI2212","title":"Technologies of the Self: from Socrates to Self-Help","description":"In this module, we will study technologies of the self, practices that individuals adopt in order to transform themselves in light of their ideals. We will look at the origins of this concept in the study of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and discuss texts drawn from Western and Eastern traditions that recommend particular practices of self-transformation. Throughout the module, we will also consider whether ancient technologies of the self are still relevant today and to what extent contemporary selfimprovement approaches and forms of digital selffashioning are modern examples of technologies of the self or a qualitatively different phenomenon."},{"moduleCode":"UPI2213","title":"Making Sense of Colonial Ideology and Its Legacies","description":"The rule of Britain, France and the Netherlands in the 18th-20th centuries have left behind a conflicting legacy in different parts of Asia. On the one hand, they destroyed—even if only partially—the cultural traditions as well as socio-economic infrastructure of their colonies. On the other, they established political, economic, social and cultural institutions that colonialized subjects have to different degrees benefitted from till this day. This module will examine how this conflicting legacy came about, so that students will be more analytically equipped in making sense of it."},{"moduleCode":"UQF2101E","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Our Eco-Footprint","description":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of one important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.\n\nIn this particular iteration of the module, we will learn to make appropriate measurements to quantify the ecofootprint arising out of our current personal lifestyle\nchoices, conduct systematic thought/real experiments to explore improvement opportunities, and propose a modelbased sustainable alternative for ourselves, our families or communities such as the USP Residential College."},{"moduleCode":"UQF2101G","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Nuclear Risks","description":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can \nprovide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.  \n\nThis module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks.

At once celebrated and contested, Singapore’s multiculturalism is imbued with various themes and meanings, and poses many important issues and challenges central to personal, group and national cultural identities as well as to political, economic and social life.  How did it come to be a core principle in nation-building?  What are state imperatives and social processes and state imperatives in its historical making and constant remaking?  Why are race, language and religion its core constitutive elements and how have their saliency evolved over time?   What are its main controversial features and areas of tensions, and how do these affect identities, social relations between individuals, groups and communities, and impact social cohesion, citizenship and belonging? How is it further impacted by massive immigration?  Is its present official form still valid in light of immigration, changing demographics and competing claims of rights and responsibilities?  What does multiculturalism mean in citizens’ memories of the past, experiences in their present everyday lives, and imaginings of the future? This module explores and discusses these central questions and significant dimensions, issues and problems in Singapore’s contested multiculturalism through a combination of lectures, seminars, on-site learning, research projects, class presentations and personal reflections.

What kinds of definitions have been advanced or implied for this perplexing word? How have thinkers - in fields as diverse as anthropology, history, literature, philosophy, psychology, science studies, and sociology - helped to define and even invent this category that we call \"gender\"? How have these definitions changed the way we think? What kinds of problems have these definitions created? In this module, we will analyse various moments in intellectual history when there has been a struggle over the meaning of \"gender\" (and seemingly related terms like \"sex\" and \"sexuality\") in order to understand the term's function as a category of analysis."},{"moduleCode":"USR4002A","title":"Critical Reflection","description":"This course prepares students for intellectual life beyond the university by modelling and asking students to engage in responsible reading, thinking, teaching, writing, and dialogue. The module will be taught by a multidisciplinary faculty of four and will examine a theme from several disciplinary perspectives.

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world.  Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given. \n\nRegistration for this one-year long module will be opened for a new intake of first-year students only in Semester 2 of each academic year."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1102B","title":"Junior Seminar: The Darwinian Revolution","description":"The scientific developments of the 19th century from geology to palaeontology, culminating in the theory of evolution by natural selection are arguably the greatest transformations in our understanding of the natural world in human history. Much of the science of the following century has been further refinements and elaborations of these earlier foundations. Yet most of these developments remain totally unknown or misunderstood by most people. Surely, therefore, an understanding of these issues is essential knowledge for any educated person today."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1102C","title":"Junior Seminar: Fakes","description":"In this junior seminar, students will examine the significance of various kinds of false appearances such as counterfeits, forgeries, hoaxes, and liars, together with attempts to expose them – sometimes with the help of sophisticated technologies. By critically examining what it means to designate an object, practice or person as ‘fake’, and how different kinds of fakes are judged as more or less problematic, students will develop the capacity to think critically and relationally about deep-seated human desires for ‘truth’ and ‘value’."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1102G","title":"Junior Seminar: Proof: What’s Truth got to do with it?","description":"An essential part of an educated person is an independent desire to know the truth.  In seeking the truth, one must often judge a proffered proof. This seminar will discuss the relationship between Truth and Proof in biology, ecology, history, justice, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, physics, religion, statistics, etc.  This helps the student see both the hard, objective formulation of the two concepts in the sciences, as well as their soft, subjective abstraction in the humanities."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1102R","title":"Junior Seminar: Green Capitalism: A Critical Engagement","description":"How do we know how green companies are? How do managers know? This module is about information and knowledge as social phenomena. Nature does not tell us how green companies are; the information that shows us ‘green capitalism’ as a solution and a reality is constructed by humans. This module is about how environmental managers know and do 'greening', and about the problems of such knowing and doing. The focus is not on engaging in green capitalism, but on engaging with it, critically. More broadly, you will pick up skills for dealing with uncertainty, uncommon ground and contradictions."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1102S","title":"Living and Dying in the Internet Age","description":"Now, more than ever, we live, die and live on through Internet technologies such as Web sites, social networking platforms and gaming environments.

Using different disciplinary perspectives, this module will dwell on two questions: (1) How do we make sense of life, death and after-death in the Internet era? (2) How can we respond, through new ways of thinking, practices, policy or design, to the new challenges and questions associated with life, death and after-death today?"},{"moduleCode":"UTC1112A","title":"Jr Sem Special Topics: Humanising Technology","description":"The late Steve Jobs, former CEO of the Apple company, has been credited with ‘humanising technology’: recognising that technology design needs to be sensitive to human characteristics. In this Junior Seminar, students will be exploring various ways of thinking about the relationship between the ‘technical’ and the ‘human’. What can these tell us about the organization of social life, and how (if at all) do they contribute to the design of ‘better’ technologies? A central role will be reserved for ethnographic studies of technology‐in‐use – an\nacademic approach that has gained traction with industry over the past decades. Students will also acquire hands‐on experience of this approach by\nstudying technology‐in‐use among friends, in the home, in the College/University, or workplace."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1114","title":"Junior Seminar From the Fire to the Frying Pan: Cooking and Eating in Human Culture(s)","description":"Cooking has evolved in unexpected ways throughout human history and has always been one of the most important markers of human culture(s). By engaging scholarship from various disciplines (but particularly anthropology), this course explores major themes that inform the way humans prepare food across different cultures and time periods. We will particularly concentrate on the prominent example of fish. Fieldtrips will be made to one of Singapore’s fishing ports and fish farms, and students will learn to apply ethnographic methods to the Singapore context. Students will also get to cook fish based on specific themes. Vegetarians and vegans are welcome."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1117","title":"Junior Seminar: Radiation and Society","description":"Reports of radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan, following the earthquake/tsunami disaster in 2011, have triggered concern and even panic among members of the general public. In this seminar, we adopt a multi‐disciplinary approach to debates and controversies about radiation and nuclear technology. Key topics include: (1) the science behind radiation effects, and the way in which policymakers and others grapple with scientific uncertainties; (2) the challenges of expert‐lay communication about radiation risk, both after nuclear disaster and relating to consumer technologies; (3) the broader context that shapes debates over nuclear power in Japan and elsewhere."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1119","title":"Junior Seminar: Crime and Punishment","description":"Understanding crime is important for those who, through the machinery of the state, would seek to impose punishment upon the criminal. This course gives students the opportunity to consider the nature of crime and punishment from a number of perspectives in philosophy, criminology and fiction. They will examine the justifications for deeming behaviour criminal, the causes of this behaviour, as well as the divergent legal responses to it across time and cultures and with changes in technology. Through the use of case studies, students will test their\nintuitions about when the imposition of punishment is morally acceptable."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1402","title":"Jr Sem: Generation Y: Transitions to Adulthood","description":"This course explores the changes in the life transition from adolescence to adulthood in today’s developed world. We will look at some of the popular understandings of emerging adulthood by studying an age group of people called  “adultolescents”, “twixters”, or “kippers”. We will also critically analyse aspects of emerging adulthood with regards to education, job opportunities, love and marriage, as well as parenting. Finally, we reflect on the kind of citizens these emerging adults are becoming, how they can engage in the community, and what the future holds for them."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1403","title":"Jr Sem: Hidden Communities","description":"There are various ‘hidden communities’ in Singapore that do not gain much public attention but whose members require special consideration from society. People with disabilities, children with learning difficulties, the elderly or migrant workers are among them. They face distinct challenges to live independent and productive lives. Each semester, the module focuses on one specific group and examines that group’s challenges, and best practices in Singaporean and international contexts. Engaging with hidden communities in Singapore is one of the key features of understanding global issues in a local context, so-called ‘Glocalisation’ (globalisation + localisation) to form active citizenship in a healthy society."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1404","title":"Jr Sem: Power and Ideas","description":"According to cultural theorists like Stuart Hall, Michel Foucault and Antonio Gramsci, the structures that support dominant ideas in society could be political, economic, religious or cultural, among others. This module examines the power structures behind the dominant ideas of our time, asking why these structures have an interest in promoting or discrediting ideas about what is ‘good’ for our community and mankind. These ideas include human rights, citizenship, democracy, meritocracy, the ‘Washington Consensus,’ development, age of majority, and political correctness."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1408","title":"Jr Sem: Technology and Human Progress","description":"Technology is the creation and use of tools, techniques and processes to solve a problem or perform a specific function. In this junior seminar, students will explore and understand emergent technologies (informational, biomedical, assistive, instructional etc) and will seek to understand technologies from multidisciplinary perspectives. Students will pursue a specific area of interest (eg a specific new technology, and related ethical or legal issues) in-depth, and consider the potential implications of the widespread use of these technologies, both in advancing human progress; and the social, ethical and legal dilemmas they may pose to society."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1409","title":"Jr Sem: The Pursuit of Happiness","description":"This module introduced a comprehensive perspective on ‘happiness’ and related social constructs such as satisfaction and quality of life. Drawing from  multidisciplinary research in Singapore and around the world, the following issues are discussed in detail: Does rising GDP lead to more happiness? Who are the people who are happy? Can money buy happiness? What really makes people happy? Can the government manufacture happiness for its citizens?"},{"moduleCode":"UTC1414","title":"Jr Sem: Discovering Singapore’s Natural History and Heritage","description":"This multidisciplinary module traces the natural history of Singapore and the region via the Spice Trade, European colonialism and independence. The founding of the Botanic Gardens and LKCNHM are set in this historical context.

Families affect the way we live, play, and work, shaping our values and how we relate to others. In this module, students will investigate and engage with issues that surround and\ndefine what it means to be a Singaporean family in the 21st century. They will look at issues such as broken and singleparent families, foster care, family leisure, family businesses etc - through economic, social, and psychological perspectives. The module emphasises experiential learning and application of readings outside the classroom through field trips, guest speakers and discussions/interviews with\nfamilies and communities."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1416","title":"Jr Sem: Games, Game Communities and Society","description":"The global games industry has overtaken film and music in annual revenue. Its reach has also extended beyond children and teens to working adults, including women. This module evaluates board and digital games and their influence on culture and communities. How do games impact our health, relationships, businesses, and behaviour? Can they change the ways we learn, interact, and understand the world? What makes games engaging or even potentially addictive? We engage communities such as professional gamers and their audiences, game designers, entrepreneurs, and women in gaming, and explore the impact of emerging technologies such as Augmented and Virtual Reality."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1417","title":"Jr Sem: Bioethics in the 21st Century","description":"Bio-medicine and biotechnology are rapidly progressing technologies in the 21st century. Who carries responsibility for debating the ethical use of these innovations – national committees, or everyday citizens? Debating bioethics requires some knowledge of three areas: bio-medicine and biotechnology themselves, theories of ethics, and methods of logical reasoning with regards to the ethical applications of the technologies to people at different stages of life. We will explore issues running from the beginning of human life (such as cloning), throughout life (such as biological enhancements) and at life’s end (such as the ethics of\nassisted death)."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1702B","title":"Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare","description":"Does a virus attack any individual? Or, does an individual create conditions for infection? How should hospitals plan treatment strategies and patient-staff movements during an outbreak? Should government allocate more resources\nto prevent onset of chronic diseases rather than managing the complications arising out of chronic diseases? Students will approach such questions from a systems perspective, which involves: understanding behaviours of subsytems and stakeholders such as disease/ infection, patients, providers, payers and society. They will also learn how the interdependencies and interactions between the different actors of the system can be integrated into a holistic system that enables better understanding."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1702C","title":"Thinking in Systems: Sustainability and Us","description":"How does our day-to-day actions and living habits affect our\nenvironment? How effectively can we engage the public,\ngovernment and other stakeholders to shape a sustainable\nenvironment for humanity? Students will analyze these\nquestions from a systems perspective by developing\nqualitative and quantitative models that can map the\ninterconnections and interdependencies between\nstakeholders involved in current sustainability challenges\nfacing humanity (examples: energy consumption, zero\nwaste and recycling). In this module, students will not only\ndevelop a good understanding on sustainability challenges,\nbut also on how actions of individuals can add up to cause\nsuch challenges."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1702D","title":"Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics","description":"Many of the world’s problems are linked to population changes: rapidly aging population, immigration woes, and the threat of environmental degradation to human existence.\n\nIn this module, students will be introduced to population trends and be equipped to better understand fertility, mortality and migration and how they cause changes in population size, composition and distribution. It  incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics.\n\nStudents will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1702E","title":"Thinking in Systems: Energy Systems","description":"Are energy sources infinite? Do energy policies lead to a sustainable energy development? Would renewables solve our future energy needs, mitigate emissions and protect our environment? Students deal with such energy challenges by learning to understand ‘energy systems’ as a ‘complex\nwhole’. This module provides a platform for students to understand the complex behavior arising from interdependent interactions of different actors of energy systems with other economic, political, social, technological and environmental factors. To achieve this, it engages students to learn and apply systems thinking tools to such aforementioned challenges through relevant models, case studies and real-world energy policy/problem scenarios."},{"moduleCode":"UTC1702F","title":"Thinking in Systems: Disaster Resilience","description":"Disasters like floods, storms, new disease outbreaks are increasing in the world. Climate change adds new hazards and uncertainties to existing risks. But are disasters a result of increasing hazards or are we becoming more vulnerable to them? Will they remain as hazards if we plan for resilience? Is resilience built or managed? Students will critically analyse these questions through a systems approach developing qualitative and quantitative models to understand relations between hazards, vulnerability, policy interventions and development practices. The module will encourage students to analyse case studies and grasp the dynamic complexity between risks, social vulnerability and resilience."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2101","title":"Time and Life","description":"There are few things that impact our lives as much as our sense of time. Singapore is a ‘fast-paced’ city where deadlines, time-saving apps and fertility clocks shape people’s actions and experiences, and where many feel ‘time poor’, even if they are cash rich. In this module, we examine the ways in which we take time for granted through analysing the ways in which our lives are temporally grounded. We do so particularly through tracing connections between individual experience, social life and technologies such as clocks and watches, electric lighting and the internet. Is time-stress inevitable in this day and age? What does it mean to use one’s time well?"},{"moduleCode":"UTC2102","title":"Climate Change","description":"This ‘Senior Seminar’ is required of students in their second year of residence in Tembusu College. The module will consider one of the most pressing problems of our time from multiple viewpoints. Merging insights from the sciences and humanities, students will be introduced to problems, conflicts, and debates over the causes of, and solutions to, the phenomenon of global warming and its implications for humanity. The seminar will meet weekly in small groups of 15‐20, with periodic full‐class meetings to hear guest speakers."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2107","title":"Senior Seminar: Negotiating in a Complex World","description":"We live in a world where complex negotiations take place daily. Navigating these complex negotiations requires one to be conscious of the psychological,\nhistorical, sociological, economical, and other contextual factors that shape each unique encounter. The rapid advancement in science and technology\nadds to the challenge of interpreting highly technical, domain‐specific information, which is critical in rationalizing decisions and persuading counterparts. In this module, we adopt a case study approach to dissecting complex negotiations. Students will learn to adopt both a macro and micro perspective in analysing such negotiations."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2108","title":"Senior Seminar: Technology and the Fate of Knowledge","description":"The course will look at how claims to knowledge are legitimized and how our concept and representations of it have developed over time due to the kinds of technologies that have been adopted. We examine the role and nature of\nknowledge, communication, data, trust, privacy, and related concepts from an interdisciplinary angle. Through 13 seminars, we explore these issues with examples such as big data, humanmachine interaction, engineering, and the internet. The goal of the module is to enable students to critically appreciate various forms of knowledge and assess how they shape our individual and collective lives."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2109","title":"Asia Now! The Archaeology of the Future City","description":"This module concentrates on the Asian built environment – architecture, urban planning and sustainable development. The theme of the archaeology of the future considers the many layers of the city, from examining its past to identifying its already emerging possible urban futures. Discussions and readings that provide in-depth, analytical, and critical perspectives on urbanisation and urbanism in Asia will be supplemented with a field trip to URA’s City Gallery and workshops on Futures Thinking. In particular, students will be taught the Casual Layered Analysis (CLA) methodology to help them think critically and deeply about present trends and the multiplicity of future scenarios. Through Singapore as a case study, students will gain a deeper understanding of challenges facing a rapidly-urbanising Asia, cultivate intellectual tools to evaluate these challenges and embody solutions through a hands-on creative project."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2111","title":"Picturing and Seeing Development","description":"This module considers how development is pictured and visualised and, to a lesser extent, textualised through a focus on industries such as finance, information technology, tourism and the creative industries. This visual view on development\nallows students to develop a critical, conceptual perspective on how development is imagined, performed and carried out in these industries. Through a visual engagement with field sites, the module explores the intersection and interplay\nbetween organisations and bureaucracies on one hand and broader societies and collectives on the other. Development is 'seen' through the perspectives of performance, experience, concepts and practice."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2113","title":"Gaming Life","description":"Games permeate disparate fields of knowledge and involve cultural practices that are part of everyday life. This module investigates the idea of ‘the game’ to develop an appreciation of gaming life. Games are explored in theoretical and practical ways to develop questions interrelating technology, culture, and human community. Further investigation explores gaming culture, i.e.:strategy, tactics, entanglement, addiction, pleasure, play; and domains such as ‘political’ and ‘academic’ games. Play and practice are central features. Students will engage in the construction, critique, and development of games, applying concepts to broader issues of public concern related to the production of social form."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2400","title":"Community Leadership","description":"This interdisciplinary module introduces and examines the idea of ‘community leadership’. It focuses on how ordinary individuals identify social needs in the local community and endeavour to improve the lives of vulnerable groups by\norganising grassroots solutions. These individuals include\nNobel Laureates such as Mother Teresa or Muhammad\nYunus but also ordinary unsung heroes closer to\nSingapore. Students are required to investigate the\nemergence of pioneering community leaders combining\nthe socio-historical contexts, personal psychology,\nnetworking and socialisation processes and social\nentrepreneurship. The teaching methodology incorporates\nlectures, seminar discussion, experiential exercises and\nfield study to interview real-life community leaders."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2402","title":"Environment and Civil Society in Singapore","description":"How ‘green’ is Singapore and how should we preserve biodiversity on this island?

It traces the scientific, social and economic conditions that gave rise to the global environmental movement, and to its various expressions in Singapore. Students will engage with stakeholders (scientists, officials, civil society) to understand the \nconflicts and collaborations between advocates of development and conservation. The class will make field trips to evaluate state-civil society partnerships (wildlife \nsanctuaries, green corridors, water catchment etc), and debate choices and dilemmas for the future."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2403","title":"Citizenship in a Changing World","description":"Originally a concept which bound individual members to a defined nation via relations of rights and responsibilities, “citizenship” in the 21st century is coming under unprecedented pressure from technological change and\nglobalization. This module will trace the development of the concept, the values and social assumptions which underpin citizenship, and the interactions between liberal, communitarian and civic narratives of citizenship from\nancient Greece to contemporary Singapore. Three key relationships are considered: the rights and duties of citizens in relation to government, to other citizens, and to non-citizens in and beyond the polity."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2405","title":"Emerging Asia: Successes and Challenges","description":"Why do certain societies succeed, while others fail? While some countries in East Asia such as Singapore and South Korea have achieved economic success, others in the Middle East (or ‘West Asia’) have undergone a trend of de-development, evident in the post-‘Arab Spring’social unrest . This module explores the contrasting social and economic development models of Asia’s regions. We will explore how states are formed, different economic strategies countries have pursued, weigh the impact of culture, and examine social deprivation and autocratic leadership. We uncover the deep-rooted social and economic reasons behind successful or failed development in different Asian countries."},{"moduleCode":"UTC2406","title":"Cities and nature","description":"Must urbanisation come at the expense of the environment? Using insights from urban planning, ecology, engineering, sociology and public policy, this module focuses on how cities can integrate with nature to create sustainable communities which minimise humans’ ecological footprint.

Are there significant cultural differences in parenting practices, between Singapore, Asia more broadly, and the West? Do women parent differently from men?  In this module, students will see that parenting may be universal but also a diverse experience. Drawing on case studies from Singapore, and other Asian societies, we examine how parenting roles and styles and perceptions of parenting are differentially produced across time, place and context. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will learn how broader systems of inequality through institutions, policies, experts, technology and material resources perpetuate socially stratified and fragmented experiences of parenting."},{"moduleCode":"UTS2409","title":"Mental wellness: Local and global approaches","description":"What is mental wellness? How do we define ‘(ab)normal’? How do communities across different countries and cultures perceive and promote mental health and resilience?

Students will engage with sociological research and develop their own critical positions grounded within functionalist, interactionist or critical theory frameworks in one of three areas: (1) Socialization into sport; what factors may influence initiation and continuation? (2) Socialization out of sport; in particular what are the causes and effects of burnout or retirement in competitive sport? (3) Socialization through sport; how are dimensions of identity (embodiment, gender, race, social class) developed?"},{"moduleCode":"UTW2001P","title":"Science Fiction and Empire","description":"Science fiction is less about the future than it is about the present. Many science fiction narratives critique contemporary social issues, particularly imperialism and colonialism. This course will introduce students to the theories of colonialism and their importance in a modern context. Armed with this knowledge, students will engage with classic and contemporary science fiction texts in order to understand, as well as question, how such narratives describe and proscribe ways of ordering the world.

In exploring these topics, students develop skills necessary in reading primary and secondary texts, to ask focused questions and explain why they matter, and ultimately to respond with well-formed arguments."},{"moduleCode":"UWC2101J","title":"Writing & Critical Thinking: Sites of Tourism","description":"This module like others in the Writing and Critical Thinking area helps students become better writers of argumentative essays. To do this, we will specifically examine the modern phenomenon that is tourism, asking questions such as: What is a tourist? Why do we become tourists? Why do we send postcards, take photographs, or collect souvenirs? Do tourists find ourselves when we go abroad? Do we lose ourselves? How are cultures packaged for tourists, and is this packaging always reductive? Such questions will help us to understand the assumptions behind tourism, and to explore issues of modernity, nationality, self and other, identity and culture."},{"moduleCode":"UWC2101L","title":"Writing and Critical Thinking: Conditions of Happiness","description":"In this course, we will investigate a fundamental human question: what is happiness, and what do we need to attain it? Is happiness in our own control or does it depend on external circumstances, such as wealth or freedom? Are pleasure or virtue necessary or even sufficient conditions of happiness? What constitutes a meaningful life, and how is meaning related to happiness? To reflect on such questions, we will investigate the arguments of philosophers, psychologists, economists, and other thinkers over the course of three thematic units."},{"moduleCode":"UWC2101R","title":"Writing & Critical Thinking: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on 'Mind'","description":"What is \"the mind\" and where does it fit in the interdependent histories of nature and culture on our planet? Does \"mind\" reduce to brain activity? Or is it more than just the electro-chemical exchange between neurons? As minded creatures with brains ourselves, the ways in which we delimit the mind/brain relation has enormous consequences for the ongoing construction of our legal, social, medical and ethical lives. In this module, we will study some of the major approaches to this issue, and attempt to discover what it is that we are really talking about when we are talking about \"mind.\""},{"moduleCode":"UWC2101Z","title":"Writing & Critical Thinking: Vice, the State & Society","description":"This module examines how social attitudes and government policies towards vices such as alcohol use, gambling, and prostitution have evolved in Singapore from the colonial period to the present day.

It explores foundational concepts by estranging them: among others, personhood, liberalism and neoliberalism, democracy, modernity, the nation and its borders, civil society, sovereignty, history, crime and social order. Taking Africa as one of its exemplary contexts, it will explore and evaluate some of the critiques levelled by non-western scholars at “classical” wisdom, its relationship to colonialism and empire, and the rise of industrial capitalism."},{"moduleCode":"YSS4253","title":"Ethnography as Theory and Method: Classical and Contemporary Readings","description":"Anthropologists have long argued against the radical separation of theory and method. Not only does ethnographic observation shape the knowledge it produces; anthropology’s commitment to an intersubjective world determines the kind of embedded observation, “thick description” and “grounded theory” that are its stock-in-trade. But what are ethnography and grounded theory in our late modern world, when many of the humanist assumptions on which anthropology was founded have come under critique - feminist, Marxist, queer, and postcolonial? Drawing on ethnographies past and present, this class will explore these questions through a close engagement with ethnographic texts, past and present."},{"moduleCode":"YSS4254","title":"Punishment, Politics and Culture","description":"The connections between punishment, power and justice are abundant and complex. In the acts of surveillance, confiscation, incarceration, reformation and execution that constitute penality, the state claims the right and obligation to commit acts of violence and transgression that are otherwise forbidden.
